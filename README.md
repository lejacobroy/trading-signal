# trading-signal

## why?

after trying to time the market and play the game for numerous years, I realized that I was doing it wrong.
My base thesis is now that the markets and rigged, manipulated by the market makers. They openly control the stock movements and follow their patterns.
My goal is now to exploit this openly available data via indicators and simply follow the whales.
Also, I do not have time to watch 10 stocks everyday.

## what is trading-signal?

trading-signal is a tool to help me in this goal. Think of this tool as a free tradingview alert system.
I'm using it to define a stock screener that I want to keep an eye on.
Then, I set some trigger alerts (indicator value, crossing, etc) and get notified when the stock meets the criteria.
I can then manualy decide to get into a trade of not.
